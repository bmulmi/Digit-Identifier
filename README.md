# Digit-Identifier
 Multilayer Perceptron Analysis
A program that identifies the hand-written digits by using multi-layer perceptron. 

The hyperparameters were altered to study the effects in the training and testing data accuracies.
Hyperparameters include the learning rate, minibatch size, activation function, number of neurons, and number of hidden layers.
